## Library : React.

## What is Sort-visualizer ?

    Sort-visualizer is a Data Structure sorting algorithm model visualization application.
    User can see the inner functions of the sorting algorithm with time delay and respective color code changes.

## Algorithms Available :
    
    1. Insertion sort.
    2. Selection sort.
    3. Heap sort.
    4. Bubble sort.
    5. Merge sort.
    
## Behind the Scenes :

    1. In this project we visualise the changes in sort algorithms using Generators and timeouts.
    2. All sorting algorithms are done by Iterative functions and Recursive way is not used here.
    3. For the accurate timing results I'm Hold functions two times per cycle.

## How to Install :

    1. clone or download the project.
    2. do "npm install"
    3. run "npm start"
    4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## How to Use :

    1. While landing the page application will select a default sort method and generate arrays.
    2. Click "start" then unsorted array will begin to sort.
    3. Once array is sorted array elements color will switch to "pink".
    4. Then generate array using button, "Generate new array" and adjust time delays to see the visuals with various sort methods.
    5. Clik "start" to begin sorting.
    6. Change the array size and play more with sort methods.(maximum array size is 100)
